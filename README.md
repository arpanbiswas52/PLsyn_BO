# PLsysn_BO

This is an experimental code (not fully developed yet) for BO with automted experiments: https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/PLsyn_BO/blob/main/AE_PLDsysn.ipynb

- In this example, we have an experimental set up of $WSE_2$ monolayer flims grown by PLD. 

- We want to optimize the control parameters for best experimental results.

- Here we develop the BO framework which can be connected to experiments to get outputs for function evaluation
